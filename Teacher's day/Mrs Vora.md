Dear Mrs Vora,

  You are understanding,

  nice, and caring.

  You never lose your cool,

  even when we act like fools.

  You continue being kind,

  even when we don't get things right.

  And if anyone deserves a day off from school,

  I have no doubts that it should be you!

  Wishing a very Happy Teacher's Day from me to you!

  Thank you for all that you do!
